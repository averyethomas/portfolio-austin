          p My name is Austin Thomas. I am currently majoring in Advertising and minoring in Studio Art at UNC Chapel-Hill.
          p If you're looking at this site I am probably asking you for an internship. I can't imagine why else you'd be here really, but anyone is welcome!
          p Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I want to conquer the advertising industry before my late night talk show career takes off. I love art and may be one of the last 100 people on Tumblr just for that reason. I am also very into comedy. Louis C.K. Aziz Ansari. John Mulaney. Music wise, I'm a big fan but have found it's probably better if I don't make my own. Frank Ocean's "Blonde" was the best album of 2016. Jury is still out on 2017.
          p I appreciate you spending some time here. I'm a motivated guy who just wants to see himself go far and make the coolest stuff he can.
